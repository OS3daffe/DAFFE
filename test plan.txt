DAFFE TEST PLAN:


Test scenario's:
- empty   = 0 entries of 4K
- 100 MiB = 25K entries of 4K
- 1 GiB   = 250K entries of 4K
- 10 GiB  = 2.5M entries of 4K


Deploy instances locally and EC2:
- Ireland (DAFFE 3)
- Frankfurt (DAFFE 4)
- West Virginia
- Singapore
- Amsterdam (use DAFFE2 preferred)


Measure:
- Migration time                        (time flocker-deploy daffeflock-deployment2.yml daffeflock-application.yml)
- Downtime during migration             (mongotime.sh modified to log to file for graph)
- Latency before and after Migration    (ping servers mongodb)


Predictions:
- Migration time increases a lot
- Downtime increases only a little
- Latency should improve once data is closer


Explain issues:
- IPTABLES investigation (short time)
- Connections between containers
- Reliability of software
- Fedora / Xen / kernel / ZFS compatibility


Future work:
- IPTABLES!!!!!
- Analytics
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- Ansible module

- Slides in Google Docs
- Research question
- Explaining components
- Graph of network config one server
- Graph of multiple server
- Explain measurements
- Conclusions
- Problems and future work
- Questions
